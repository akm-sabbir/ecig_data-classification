1/2 E-cig draft amendment sent to all MEPs for comment by my Belgian Liberal colleague Frederique Ries. Winning lots of support. #ecigs 2/2 E-cig draft parliamentary amendment here. To be tabled by Wednesday for 8 Oct votes. http://t.co/1KB20pkURH. #ecigs 1/3 Looks like we are close to having a majority for the e-cig amendment tabled by Belgian Liberal MEP Frederique RIes and myself. #ecigs 2/3 EPP and ECR groups have joined with ALDE (Libs) to pledge support for it. Votes in Parliament in Strasbourg next Wednesday. #ecigs 3/3 Its not a soft approach. No medicinal regs for ecigs, but strict controls on advertising and sales to young people. #ecigs E-cigs. Why a tough approach when e-cigs can save lives? We need to get a majority. Better than restrictive medicinal regulation. #ecigs E-cigs. Still trying to win support from Labour MEPs. MEPs may back e-cigs but we need a big majority to negotiate with governments. #ecigs E-cigs vote in European Parliament (Tobacco Products Directive) now due on Tuesday about noon Strasbourg time. #ecigs Commissioner Boge just called for larger picture warnings on cig packs. Commission opposed them when I tabled the idea in 2002. #ecigs

Calder Valley media coverage of #LibDem campaign for sensible regulation of electronic cigarettes: http://t.co/Tne3X9ZcM2 #TPD #ecigs @schristieauthor @Hifistud ASH study says what little use of #ecigs exists in kids/teen is found only smokers/ex-smokers.. @schristieauthor @Hifistud I would prefer kids/teens never started smoking, so they wouldn't need harm reduction of #ecigs : ) @tobyatbrek #Ecigs vapour is not harmful to others (doesn't even smell) unlike tobacco smoke, so indoor ban would not be on health grounds @tobyatbrek but I think it's reasonable for employer to say no #ecigs while doing job esp if public/client facing as looks unprofessional @emcmillanscott and I have written to the papers in the region on the issue of #Ecigs. More at the website - http://t.co/LlqP3DY1O7 @ecigaretteforum @F3zzer @Hifistud @Kibbster666 @Save_ecigs @grumplemoose NO! #ecigs not reason #EPP asked to delay #TPD. @ecigaretteforum NO! #tobacco co's have lobbied far far harder on packaging, flavour ban etc; #ecigs barely mentioned. @neil_october @F3zzer @Hifistud my view is #tobacco as public health scourge needs tackling on many fronts; ie tobacco control & #ecigs
